##Data Finder using Angular.js
==========

This the implementation of an abstract finder which consumes the API that is served from
Agro-Know over an elasticsearch repository.

###Main Purpose
of this finder-app is to have an open-source, lightweight, cross-platform solution for searching
our data pools, and that is easy to embodied in every web site.
It's implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

###Technologies

1. **AngularJS** is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running single-page applications.
Its goal is to augment web-based applications with model?view?controller (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier.

2. **Native AngularJS (Angular) directives for Twitter's Bootstrap.**
Small footprint (5kB gzipped!), no 3rd party JS dependencies (jQuery, bootstrap JS) required!
